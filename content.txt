Major indexes dropped to session lows at the close Friday as looming tariffs took a toll on stocks. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) broke key levels, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) edged lower amid a new offering on the stock market today.

Late Friday, the White House said President Donald Trump had ordered the implementation of aggressive tariffs on key trading partners as early as Saturday. The plan is to impose 25% tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% charge on goods from China. According to reports, almost 30% of all imported goods in the U.S. come from its trading neighbors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled under the news and dropped 337 points for a loss of 0.8%. After some positive progress in the morning, the S&P 500 reversed direction and finished 0.5% lower. Among the S&P sectors, energy lagged the most and only two sectors, communication services and consumer discretionary gained.

Also, the Nasdaq composite also gave up early robust gains and sank by 0.3% at the close. All three major indexes managed to remain above their 50-day moving averages, however.
